          <h2>Life</h2>
          <p>Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez (15 August 1917 – 24 March 1980) was the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador, capital city of El Salvador. Although the designation of Romero as Archbishop was celebrated by all the olicarquic society in El Salvador, his behavior in defense of poorest and most margined people soonly granted him lot of enemies.</p>
          <p>It was common to see him offering Mass in poor towns, eating beans and corn tortillas with farmers, and refusing to separate the religious acts by social class</p>
          <p>He refused to be guard by police officers, he argued that he needs the same protection that all salvadorian people.</p>
          <p>In his most famous homily, and with a salvadoran population mostly catholic, he call to all military and police corps to stop killing their salvadorean brothers and sisters.</p>
          <p>One day after that he was killed while offerring Mass in the moment of the consecration of bread and wine (most sacred part of Mass). Its funeral, attenden by five percent of the population, even it was so dangerous, was marked by the explosion of bombs and rifle shots, between 30 and 50 people died. Many priests and nuns took risks in the middle of the bullets to take him to his grave</p>
          <p>Romero will be canonized by Pope Francisco in Rome in October 14</p>
